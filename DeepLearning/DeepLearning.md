# Deep Learning

## Background

### What is deep learning?
- More neurons
- More complex ways of connecting layers
- "Cambrian explosion" of computing power in training
- Auto feature extraction

### Some typical architectures
- Unsupervised pretrained networks
- CNN
- Recurrent neural networks
- Recursive neural networks

### Applications

- **Inceptionsim** is a technique in which a trained CNN is taken with its layers in reverse order and given an input image coupled with a prior constraint. The images are modified iteratively to enhance the output in a manner that could be described as hallucinative.
- **Modelling artistic style** CNN extracts the artist's style into networks' parameters which can later be applied to arbitrary images


### Building blocks

- RBMS
- Autoencoders
