# Read best Taolus of IT industry

XMBSMDSJ is a philosophy of XM BSs. What is XM? and what is BS? BS mean Bishen, which is the output of  bijing dashen. 


```haskell

bijing :: Person -> Person -> Maybe Dashen
dashen :: Person

bishen = bijing dashen
msg <- xm bishen
putStrLn msg

> Xian mu bi shen men de shi jie

```
Bishen is like kind of qualification of Dashen. If a dashen or a person is un-qualified, it's always evaluated as `Nothing` in most of function implementations related to Dashen class. XM is like an I/O function which informed verified dashens of the fact that they are qualified and has gained high reputation. While un-qualified dashens (渣渣s like me) will also be used as the param of XM, but there is no underlying message delivered to them.

IT is quite hard to learn, especially for 渣渣 like me. The lecture at unimleb sucks, and the slides are pretty hard to read. Therefore we will need some new technique to learn the subjects, which is called Tao Lu.

Tao Lu is a advanced unsupervised learning model. It requires non-deterministic machine to participate and is fully compatible with human brain. One weakness is that this model can neither be used on any von Neumann architecture computers nor any types of quantum computers.

- Crawling: Fetch as many questions as possible to be the training dataset.
- Training: Train the model using questions. If the process halt detected, feedback the signal into the model and query the keyword in lecture slides
- Testing: Select some qustions as testing set
- Non-blocking real time evaluation: Check out 大佬's conversation in wechat group and look for something that the model has not seen before, feed back into the system and re-update the weights
