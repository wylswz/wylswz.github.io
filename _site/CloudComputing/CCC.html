<h3 id="types-of-parallelisms">Types of parallelisms</h3>
<p><strong>Implicit parallelism</strong> means
parallel languages and parallelizing compilers that take care of identifying parallelism, the scheduling of calculations and placement of data. This is quite hard to do though.</p>

<p><strong>Explicit parallelism</strong> requires the programmer to take effort of parallelization, like mapping tasks to processors and inter-process communications. This approach assumes user is the best judge of how parallism can be exploited for a particular application.</p>

<h3 id="hardware-parallelism-level">Hardware parallelism level</h3>
<p>In hardware threading CPU, extra control units are added to allow more instructions to be processed per cycle. They usually share arithmetic units, so heavy use of one type of computation can tie up the available units of the CPU preventing other threads from using them.</p>

<p>Multi-core CPU can perform computational tasks in parallel in principle. The Control units have indenpendant arithmatic units but share cache.</p>

<p>Symmetric Multiprocessing means two or more identical processors connected to a single shared main memory, with full access to all I/O devices, controlled by a single OS that treats all processors equally. It’s more complex to program since need to program both CPUs and inter-processor communications.</p>

<p>Non-Uniform Memory Access provides speed up by allowing a processor to access its local memory faster than non-local memory. As long as data are localized, performance is improved.</p>

<h3 id="software-parallelism-approaches">Software Parallelism Approaches</h3>

<p>Most languages support parallelization features like Threads, Pools, Lock, Semaphores. There are some key issues that need to be tackled. Deadlock (Process constantly wait for each other), Livelock (Processes involved in livelock constantly change with regard to one another, but none are progressing)</p>

<p>Message passing interface (MPI) is widely adoped approach for message passing in parallel system. Key MPI functions include MPI_Init, MPI_Finalize, MPI_COMM_SIZE, MPI_COMM_RANK, MPI_SEND, MPI_RECV, … It supports both point to point and broadcast communications.</p>

<p>(HT)Condor It is a specialized workload management system for compute-intensive jobs. It offers job queueing mechanisms, scheduling policies, priority schemes, resource monitoring/management. Users submit jobs to Condor and it chooses when and where to run the job, monitors their progress and informs the user upon completion. There no need for shared file system across machines, data can be staged to machines as needed.</p>

<h3 id="facts-about-distributed-systems">Facts about Distributed Systems</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Network is unreliable</li>
  <li>Latency</li>
  <li>Limited Bandwidth</li>
  <li>Network is insecure</li>
  <li>Topology changes</li>
  <li>Transport cost</li>
  <li>Heterogeneous networks</li>
  <li>Time is not synchronized</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-design-a-parallel-system">How to design a parallel system?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Partitioning</strong>: Decomposition of computational activities and data into smaller tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Communication</strong>: <strong>Flow</strong> of information and <strong>coordination</strong> among tasks that are created in the partitioning stage.</li>
  <li><strong>Agglomeration</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Tasks and communication structure created in the above stages are evaluated for performance and implement cost</li>
      <li>Tasks may be grouped into larger tasks to improve comm</li>
      <li>Individual comm can be bundled</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mapping</strong>: Assigning tasks to processors such that job completion time is minimized and resource utilization is maximized.</li>
</ul>

<p>In master-slave model, master decomposes the problem into small tasks and distributes to workers and gather partial results to produce final result.</p>

<h3 id="shared-memory-parallelism-mp">Shared memory parallelism (MP)</h3>
<p>Multi-threading is one type of shared memory parallelism. A master forks a number of sub threads and diveide tasks between them. One implementation is OpenMP, which is limited to single instance.</p>

<h3 id="distributed-memory-parallelism-mpi">Distributed memory parallelism (MPI)</h3>
<p>Programs are parallelized by sending messages between processes. Some functions in MPI are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bcast</strong>: Broadcast same piece of data to all processes</li>
  <li><strong>Scatter</strong>: Send a part of data from one process to all the processes (each process get different pieces of data)</li>
  <li><strong>Gather</strong>: Gather data from all processes</li>
  <li><strong>Reduce</strong>: Perform a reduce operation, return the result to root.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="parallism-patterns">Parallism Patterns</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Master-Slave</strong>: Master decomposes problem to smaller tasks, distribute them to workers and gather the results. Many ways to do it: Threading, Web service workflow …</li>
  <li><strong>Single Process Multiple Data</strong>: Each process executes same piece of code but on different parts of data. Data is splitted among available processors</li>
  <li><strong>Data Pipelining</strong>: Includ multiple stages of execution, that typically operate on large number of dataset</li>
  <li><strong>Divide &amp; Conquer</strong>: Divide problem into sub-problems which can be independently solved. Master-worker is like divide &amp; conquer with master doing split and join operation.</li>
  <li><strong>Look ahead execution</strong>: C depends on P for some output value V,  then C predict V. If that’s correct, there’s a performance gain, otherwise restart the task with correct V.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cluster-computing-l4">Cluster Computing (L4)</h2>

<h3 id="concepts">Concepts</h3>
<p>Supercomputer is a single computer system that has exceptiona; processing power for its time. One metric is the number of floating-point operation per second (FLOPS).</p>

<p>High-performance computing (HPC) is any computer system whose architecture allows for above average performance.</p>

<p>Clustered computing is when two or more computers servce a single resource (improved performance and redundancy). A collection of smaller computers strapped together with a high-speed local network.</p>

<p>Research computing is the software application used by research comminity to aod research. THis skill gap is a major problem and must be addresed because as datasets grow, the researchers will need to able to process the data.</p>

<p>Why use document-oriented DBMS for big data?</p>

<p>Relational database model implied fine-grained data, which are less conductive to partition-tolerance than coarse-grained data.</p>

<h3 id="mongodb-vs-couchdb">MongoDB vs CouchDB</h3>

<p>CouchDB cluster is simpler, more available. Accepts HTTP requests. All the nodes accept requests. If data unavailable, it fetch from other node and return to user.</p>

<p>CouchDB cluster uses MVCC, while MongoDB uses a mix of two-phase commit for consistency and Paxos-like algorithm for leader election.</p>

<p>When a CouchDB cluster is partitioned and two nodes receive two different updates of the same document, two different revisions are added. However, only one of these is returned as the current version.</p>

<p><img src="/CloudComputing/L7/couch.png" alt="CouchDB Architecture" /></p>

<p>When partitioning happens in MongoDB which separate a primary into a partition with a minority of nodes, when primary detects that it can only see a minority of nodes, it steps down and a members in majority oartition holds election to become the new primary</p>

<p>MongoDB clusters are more complex, more consistent and less available. The sharding is on the replicaset level. Routers must be embedded in application servers. Only master node accept queries (depending on configurations)</p>

<h3 id="cap-theorem">CAP theorem</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Every client receives the same answer from all nodes in the cluster.</li>
  <li><strong>Availability</strong>: Every client receives an answer from any node in cluster</li>
  <li><strong>Partition-tolerance</strong>: The cluster keeps on operating when one or more nodes cannot communicate with rest of the cluster.</li>
</ul>

<p>Consistency and availability are at odds when a Partition happens. Traditional databasrs are not concerned with network partitions, since all data were supposed to be in a small co-located cluster of servers.</p>

<p><strong>Consistency and Availability: Two-phase commit</strong>
It enforces consistency by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lock data within transaction scope</li>
  <li>Perform transaction on write-ahead logs</li>
  <li>Commit only when all nodes have performed the transaction</li>
  <li>Abort when partition detected</li>
</ul>

<p>Commit request phase:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Coordinator sends a query to commit msg to all participants, wait until reply</li>
  <li>Participant execute the transaction up to the point where they will be asked to commit. They write an entry to undo log and redo log</li>
  <li>Each participant votes yes if success, or no if execution fail.</li>
</ul>

<p>Commit phase:
The commit is success if all participants agree to commit. It fails if any of them vote “No”.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Coordinator sends commit/rollback to all participants</li>
  <li>The participants finish commit or undo it, then release lock.</li>
  <li>Participants send ACK to coordinator</li>
  <li>Coordinator complete-abort transaction after recving all ACKs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Availability and Partition Tolerance: MVCC</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Commit updates without locks</li>
  <li>Transaction that completes last has larger revision number</li>
  <li>When partition is solved, same rev number may cause conflict</li>
  <li>Couchdb returns a list of current conflicts to be solved by application.</li>

<p><strong>Consistency and Partition Tolerance: Paxos</strong></p>

<p>Paxos ensures no matter what if data is written, it eventually propagate to all nodes. There will never be different nodes that think that some index contains different value.</p>

<p>Some assumptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Message contents don’t change after sent</li>
  <li>No bugs or hackers</li>
  <li>Storage persistant if system is down</li>
</ul>

<p>Building blocks</p>
<ul>
  <li>Leader election protocol</li>
  <li>Consensus on a single log entry (Synod) that preserves safety</li>
  <li>Protocol to manage the entire log</li>
</ul>

<p>The alg orithm overview</p>
<ul>
  <li>Continuously run leader election algorithm, making sure all nodes know who’s in charge.</li>
  <li>When leader receives a request to add ITEM to log, it selects next empty log index, and initiate a consensus on adding data to log (Ballot)</li>
  <li>When consensus initiated, all nodes participate in it, eventually aggreeing that item was added to log as INDEX.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="big-data-processing-l8">Big data processing (L8)</h2>

<p>Challenges of big data analysis:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Need to read and write distributed datasets</li>
  <li>Preserve data in the presence of fail node\</li>
  <li>Execute map reduce tasks</li>
  <li>Fault-tolerant (nodes that fail computing only slow down the process instead of stop it)</li>
  <li>Coordinating task execution across a cluster</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hadoop">Hadoop</h3>

<p>Hadoop HDFS uses 128MB block for smaller metadata, higher network efficiency and reduce need for seek operation. It is quite efficient when most data of a block is processed.</p>

<p>Hadoop uses YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator). Resource Manger is located on master node while Node Managers are on slave nodes. Everytime a MR job is initiated, an Application Master is started to negotiate resource with Resource Manager and start containers on slave node.</p>

<p>YARN core components:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Resource Manage</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scheduler</strong> allocates resource to running Apps, subject to constraints of capacities, queues. It does not monitor or track tasks, doesn’t ensure restart failed tasks. The schedule is based on resource requirement. It has a pluggable policy plug in, which can be Capacitor Shceduler or Fair Scheduler</li>
      <li><strong>Application Manager</strong> accepting job submissions and negotiate first container from RM for app-specific App Master. It also manages running App Master in cluster and provide services for restarting.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Node Manager</strong> takes care of individual nodes, jobs and workflows in a single node</li>
  <li><strong>Application Master</strong> is unique for each application. It coordinate execution in the cluster and manage fault. It negotiate resources from RM, works with node manager to execute and monitor tasks and also send heart beat to RM to affirm its health and update its record of resource demand.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="spark">Spark</h3>
<p>Why Spark?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hadoop only performs simple tasks on large datasets</li>
  <li>Data need to be cached for comples operations</li>
  <li>Need fine grained control on executions</li>
  <li>Low latency</li>
  <li>Operate with hadoop architecture</li>
</ul>

<p>Spark components</p>
<ul>
  <li>Job: Data processing to be performed on a dataset</li>
  <li>Task: A single operation on dataset</li>
  <li>Executor: The process in which tasks are executed</li>
  <li>Cluster Manager: Process that assigning tasks to executors</li>
  <li>Driver Program: Main logic of the program</li>
  <li>Spark Application: Driver + Executor</li>
  <li>Spark Context: General configuration</li>
</ul>

<p>Spark RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset).
Resilient means Data is stored with redundancy. Failing node does not effect integrity. It has following properties</p>

<ul>
  <li>Immutable: Once defined, not changed</li>
  <li>Transient: Used only once, then discarded</li>
  <li>Lazy-evaluated: Data process only happens when data cannot not be kept in RDD (Transormations don’t evaluate RDD)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some RDD Transformations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>distinct()</strong></li>
  <li><strong>uniun(rdd)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>intersect(rdd)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>substract(rdd)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>cartesian(rdd)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Key-value Transormations</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>map(lambda)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>flatmap(lambda)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>reduceByKey(lambda)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>join(rdd)</strong>: Merge key-value pairs</li>
</ul>

<p>Actions (Evaluation happens)</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>collect()</strong>: Return all elements in an RDD</li>
  <li><strong>count()</strong></li>
  <li><strong>reduce(lambda)</strong> (different from reduce by key)</li>
  <li><strong>foreach(lambda)</strong>: apply lambda to all elems</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="virtualization-l9">Virtualization (L9)</h2>

<p><strong>VMM</strong> or <strong>Hypervisor</strong> is a piece of software that provide the abstraction of a virtual machine. When looking at the virtual environment provided by VMM, there are three properties of interest:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fidelity</strong>: Programs running under VMM exhibit identical behavior to running on an equivalent physical machine.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety</strong>: VMM is in complete control over virtual resources</li>
  <li><strong>Performance</strong>: Dominant fraction of instructions must be executed without VMM intervention</li>
</ul>

<p>Popek and Goldberg describe characteristics that ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) of physical machine must possess to run VMM with 3 properties above. There is a classification of instructions of an ISO into 3 different groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Privileged instructions</strong>: Those that trap if the processor is in user mode and do not trap if it is in system mode</li>
  <li><strong>Control sensitive instructions</strong>: Those that attempt to change the configuration of resource in the system</li>
  <li><strong>Behavior sensitive instructions</strong>: Those whose behavior or result depends on the configuration of resources (the content of the relocation register or the processor’s mode)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="theorem">Theorem</h3>
<p>For any conventional third-gen computer, an effective VMM may be constructed if the set of sensitive instruction for that computer is a subset of the set of privileged instructions.</p>

<p>This indicates that in order to build a VMM it is sufficient that all instructions that could affect the correct functioning of the VMM always trap and pass control to the VMM. This guarantees the resource control property. None privileged instructions must instead be executed natively.</p>

<p>This theorem also provides a simple technique for implementing a VMM, called trap-and-emulate virtualization, more recently called classic virtualization: because all sensitive instructions behave nicely, all the VMM has to do is trap and emulate every one of them</p>

<h3 id="virtual-machine-extensions">Virtual machine extensions</h3>
<p>x86 is not originally virtualizable. VT-x (Intel) and SVM (AMD) are introduced to satisfy popek-goldberg theorem permit entering/exiting virtual execution mode where guestOS perceives itself as running with full privilege, but host OS remains protected.</p>

<p>VMM should support following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>De-privilege</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>VMM emulates the effect on system/hardware resources of privileged instructions whose execution traps into VMM (This is achieved by running GuestOS at lower priority level than VMM)</li>
      <li>Problematic on some architectures where privileged instructions do not trap when executed at de-priveleged level.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Primary/Shadow structures</strong>: VMM maintains shadow copy of critical structures whose primary versions are manipulated by GuestOS e.g. memory page table. Primary copies need to ensure correct versions are visible to Guest OS</li>
  <li><strong>Memory traces</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Control access to memory so that the shadow and primary structure remain coherent</li>
      <li>The common strategy is write-protect primary copy so that updates which cause page fault can be caught, interpreted and addressed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="full-virtualization-vs-para-virtualization">Full virtualization vs Para-virtualization</h3>
<p>Full virtualization allow na unmodified guest OS to run in isolation by simulating full hardware. Guest OS has no idea it is virtualized.</p>

<p>With Para-virtualization, VMM exposes special interfaces to guest OS for better performance. It requires a modified/hypervisor aware Guest OS (Xen). This can optimise systems to use this interface since not all instructions need to be trapped/dealt with</p>

<h3 id="software-based-virtualization-vs-hardware-assisted-virtualization">Software based virtualization vs Hardware assisted virtualization</h3>

<p>In software based (CPU) virtualization, Guest application code runs directly on CPU. Privileged codes are translated to run on CPU. Translated codes are larger and slightly slower.</p>

<p>In hardware assisted virtualization, the processor provides hardware assistant for CPU virtualization. Guests can use a separated mode called Guest Mode (Both applications and privileged codes are running in guest mode). On certain events, the processor exit guest mode and enter root mode. Hypervisor executes in root mode, determing reason for exit and restart guest in guest mode. With hardware assist, system calls and trap intensive workloads run close to native performance. Tasks that lead to large number of exitting guest mode may affect the performance.</p>
